## Root Causes - Developers
- **Complexity of guidelines**: Accessibility guidelines can be complex and difficult to understand, especially for developers who are not familiar with them.

- **Lack of testing**: Accessibility testing can be challenging, and developers may not have the necessary tools or expertise to test for accessibility issues.

- **Limited resources**: Small development teams or organizations with limited resources may not have the budget or personnel to dedicate to accessibility efforts.

## Implications â€“ End User
- **Exclusion from digital content**: Users with disabilities may not be able to access digital content, such as websites, applications, or documents, that are not designed with accessibility in mind. This can disproportionately limit access to information.

- **Reduced independence**: Inaccessible software can limit the ability of users with disabilities to perform tasks independently, such as online shopping, banking, or communication.

- **Frustration and stress**: Users with disabilities may experience frustration and stress when trying to use inaccessible software, which can lead to negative user experiences and churn.

- **Increased risk of errors**: Inaccessible software can increase the risk of errors for users with disabilities, such as inputting incorrect information or missing important details.
